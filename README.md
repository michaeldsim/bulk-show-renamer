# bulk-show-renamer
Small python script in order to rename and organize all of my video files quickly

# Instructions
This script assumes that all of your files are all in one directory as demonstrated below (not split up into many different ones).

By default, the files should also be placed in a folder that is in the same directory as the script. (Seen below.)

# Arguments
### ```-s or --separate_dirs```
Enabling this will cause the script to split and organize the files by season.

This will use your supplied path as the input path instead of the default './input/' path
